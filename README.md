# My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It showcases my skills, projects, and experience. I designed it to be a modern, single-page application with smooth scrolling and animations.

### About The Project

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Pham Chau Thanh Tung, a recent Computer Science graduate from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). This portfolio highlights my journey as a software developer, with a focus on web and mobile application development.

The portfolio includes the following sections:

* **About**: A brief introduction to myself, my skills, and my career goals.
* **Experience**: A summary of my work experience, including my internship at MeU Solutions.
* **Projects**: A showcase of my featured and other noteworthy projects.
* **Contact**: A section with my contact information and a call to action.

### Built With

* **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **Lucide React**: A library of simply designed icons.
